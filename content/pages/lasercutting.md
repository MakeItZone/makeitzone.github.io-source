Right now we can help you with full-service 3D printing and small laser cutting projects. And we're planning classes with the Courtenay library and Linc for May-June.

We're targeting July to be fully open. 

Our pricing will have several tiers: membership, drop-in, full-service, full-service rush. 

Note: Some tools will require safety training before use.

We have a Trotec Speedy 300 80W CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutter/engraver ready to take on your cutting and engraving projects.

Want to engrave round items? No problem with our rotary-tool attachment. This allows us to engrave on cylindrical objects such as water bottles and glasses.

Get in touch to make a start on your project!

Laser engraving is a great way to uniquely mark objects.

Our laser is able to mark many materials, including wood, card, acrylic, glass, leather, fabric, coated metals, anodized aluminum, ceramics, stone, and more.

With our rotary tool we're not limited to just flat surfaces, but can also mark glasses, wine bottles, drinking bottles, etc.

Using a special marking ink, such as one of [Thermark's products](http://www.thermark.com/content/view/28/79/), we can also mark metals. Please contact us in advance to discuss options and lead time.

Nothing beats the precision, speed, and repeatability of laser cutting. With an extremely narrow kerf (cut width) material wastage can be minimized, and new design techniques can be applied.

The precision also extends not only to the location of the cuts, but also the depth. With good quality, uniform, stock material it is possible to partially cut through material. From selectively cutting the top layers of a stack of cloth to scoring fold lines on card stock, the possibilities are amazing.

Our laser is capable of cutting through wood, acrylic, plastic, delrin, cloth, leather, paper, veneer, cork and more.
    
Note: our current system is not able to cut metals.
