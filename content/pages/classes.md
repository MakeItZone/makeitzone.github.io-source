<p class="lead">We strive to bring you fun, approachable, and <em>take-home-able</em> small group experiences!</p>
<p>Many students are a little fearful of building with technology. To help them a plethora of wonderful learning tools have been created. For example, Lego&reg; MindStorms&reg;. But they can be expensive. We start with these familiar tools and use our experience and knowledge to quickly build students' confidence and competence to the point where they no longer need them. Students quickly develop the skills needed to use less expensive items such as <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard">solder-less breadboards</a>, <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>. These items are so inexpensive that students can have their own set at home and practice what they have learned. And practice is a key part of learning any new skill.</p>
<p>We endeavor to create classes that encourage students to go beyond these pre-packaged systems and create their own inventions.</p>
