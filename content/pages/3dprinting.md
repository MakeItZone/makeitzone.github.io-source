Right now we can help you with full-service 3D printing and small laser cutting projects. And we're planning classes with the Courtenay library and Linc for May-June.

We're targeting July to be fully open. 

Our pricing will have several tiers: membership, drop-in, full-service, full-service rush. 

Note: Some tools will require safety training before use.

### 3D Printing

We have two Lulzbot Taz printers that are ready to print your designs!

These are great machines that offer larger-than average build volumes: approximately 25cm x 25cm x 23cm.

We regularly print in PLA, PET-G, and ABS and can configure our machines to meet your needs- be it speed of service, strength, or finish quality.

All our machines have been upgraded with all-metal hotends. This means we can also print with more exotic materials such as polycarbonate and nylon.

We also plan to support printing in flexible materials in the near future.

To start printing your design just [contact us]({filename}contact.md) directly, or <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/service/makeitzone" data-3dhubs-widget="button" data-hub-id="55116" data-type="orderWidget" data-color="light" data-size="small" data-text="Order a 3D Print">Order a 3D Print</a> <script>!function(a,b,c,d){var e,g=(a.getElementsByTagName(b)[0],/^http:/.test(a.location)?"http":"https");a.getElementById(d)||(e=a.createElement(b),e.id=d,e.src=g+"://d3d4ig4df637nj.cloudfront.net/w/2.0.js",e.async=!0,a.body.appendChild(e))}(document,"script",1,"h3d-widgets-js");</script> from [our hub](https://www.3dhubs.com/service/makeitzone) on [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com").

###3D Design

Have an idea but don't know how to use CAD programs? We can help.

We have experience with AutoDesk 123D Design, AutoDesk 360 Fusion, as well as FreeCad and OpenSCAD.

Working with you, we will create a CAD design that is optimized for 3D printing, and provide you with all the final design files.

We can also help with existing designs that need tweaking for 3D printing- including mesh based designs created with tools such as Skulptris, MudBox, or Blender.

And if we can't help you, we'll put you in touch with someone who can.
