<em class="lead">Welcome to MakeItZone. The place to make your dreams real, and to learn by doing.  A safe and welcoming space for people with different skill sets and interests to meet, learn, and work on their projects. Building community. Building the future.</em>

Our plan is to create a __Makerspace__ here in the Comox Valley, that is accessible to all ages.

#### What is a Makerspace?

> To describe them simply, makerspaces are community centers with tools. Makerspaces combine manufacturing equipment, community, and education for the purposes of enabling community members to design, prototype and create manufactured works that wouldnâ€™t be possible to create with the resources available to individuals working alone. These spaces can take the form of loosely-organized individuals sharing space and tools, for-profit companies, non-profit corporations, organizations affiliated with or hosted within schools, universities or libraries, and more. All are united in the purpose of providing access to equipment, community, and education, and all are unique in exactly how they are arranged to fit the purposes of the community they serve.

This video does a great job of illustrating the concept:

And [this article](http://oedb.org/ilibrarian/a-librarians-guide-to-makerspaces/) has a lot of good information, from a librarian's point of view.

Makerspaces (also known as Hackspaces) are becoming very popular. There are several across BC, including Nanaimo ([Makerspace Nanaimo](https://makerspacenanaimo.org), Vancouver ([MakerLabs](http://www.makerlabs.com), [VHS](https://hackspace.ca/wp/)), North Vancouver ([Zen Maker Lab](http://zenmakerlab.com)), Surrey ([Maker Cube](http://makercube.ca)), and Victoria ([Victoria Makerspace](http://www.makerspace.ca/cpages/home)). They've even be written about in the [Georgia Straight](http://www.straight.com/life/734836/makerspaces-connect-people-and-projects-vancouver).

The Comox Valley needs it's own Makerspace!

#### When?

As soon as possible- hopefully ~July 2017.
