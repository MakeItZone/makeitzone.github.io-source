Right now we can help you with full-service 3D printing and small laser cutting projects. And we're planning classes with the Courtenay library and Linc for May-June.

We're targeting July to be fully open. 

Our pricing will have several tiers: membership, drop-in, full-service, full-service rush. 

Note: Some tools will require safety training before use.

<span class="lead">Our memberships will include:</span>

* building access during business hours
* include a number of minutes of machine time
    - eg laser cutter, CNC, etc
    - usable only after required training is completed
    - non bankable (unused minutes do not roll over to successive months)
* discounted machine use rates for equipment with a per-usage cost
* discounts on events and classes

Other perks as they are arranged.

**Prices**

Our pricing structure has yet to be finalized. Stay tuned for updates!
