		<div>Early afternoon.
People are leaving the MakeItZone carrying smiles, and interesting items- a stool, clothing that glows, a satchel.
As many, of varying ages, are entering.
There is a palpable energy and excitement in the air.
</div>
		<div> Fil.Al, Comox harbour from Goose Spit</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>…and discover classes on sewing, programming, and other skills taking place.
Individuals and groups can be seen working on projects.
</div>
		<div> Mitch Altman, VoidWarranties Workshop for Kids, Antwerp, Belgium, Nov-2012</div>
		<div> The Maryland Science Center</div>
		<div>Multiple generations. Inclusive of gender.
People are discovering. Creating. Sharing.
They are learning skills and learning about themselves.
Children learning from elders and elders learning from children.
</div>
		<div> Laura James</div>
		<div>Go further.
See tools, equipment, and materials.
It is impossible to see it all and not imagine the things that might be built.
By you.
</div>
		<div>Enter to discover a tastefully furnished space with an inventive do-it-yourself flair.
Move further inside…
</div>
